\item This code solves the {\bfseries{wave differential equation}} in time-\/ and frequency domains.
\item The options for boundary condition is a) Lysmer damping absorbing boundary, and b) Perfectly Matched Layers.
\item The seismic load prescribed in the domain through a) point load, b) D\+RM (Domain Reduction Method).
\item The solver is LD factorization method.
\item We use a full or skyline method to save global matrices.
\item Node numbers start from 0.
\item Element numbers start from 0.
\item Equation number starts from 0. ID(1 2 3 4 ) ND \mbox{[}---x--- ---y---\mbox{]}
